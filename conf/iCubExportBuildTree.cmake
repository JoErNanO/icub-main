# Code to export the project build tree. Note this is similar to the code 
# that export the installed project but is also different in important aspects.
# For this reason the code is more complicated and produces separate files.
#
# This produces a file called icub-config.cmake in ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR} that 
# other projects should execute (with find_package) to use the project.
#
# This files assumes that each target you want to export has previously 
# called icub_export_library.
#
# Files: 
# EXPORT_INCLUDE_FILE: this file contains a list of all the targets in the 
# build, and a corresponding include directories. This is generated from 
# information in cache variables (mainly ICUB_TARGETS); this is populated
# by each target by calling for example icub_export_library, see iCubHelpers.cmake).
# 
# EXPORT_CONFIG_FILE: in build directory, store libraries and dependenecies
# automatically generated with CMake export command.
# 
# BUILD_CONFIG_TEMPLATE: template for the real config file (icub-config.cmake)
# that exports the build tree
